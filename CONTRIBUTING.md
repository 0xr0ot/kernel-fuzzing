How to contribute
=================

We are very happy for contributions :-) This can include changes to existing fuzzers, changes to any of the supporting scripts, new fuzzers, or simply running the fuzzers and fixing any bugs you encounter. We are still looking into the possibility of creating a repository of testcase corpora for each fuzzer, which would allow us to generate coverage reports for the kernel and do automatic regression testing on new kernel versions.

If you are contributing a change to the official Oracle-maintained repository for the first time, please follow the instructions below to submit an Oracle Contributor Agreement.

Once you have the Oracle Contributor Agreement in place, please send us a pull request on GitHub!


Oracle Contributor Agreement
----------------------------

Oracle requires that contributors to all of its open-source projects sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA) and email or fax back the completed agreement.

The OCA gives Oracle and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code. The contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to Oracle as the project sponsor. You need only sign the OCA once in order to cover all changes that you might contribute to any Oracle-sponsored open-source project, so if you have already signed the OCA then you do not need to sign it again in order to contribute to this project.

The OCA protects the integrity of the code base, which in turn protects the development community and the project's users. Oracle acts on the community's behalf in the event of any legal challenge. In order to represent a code base against legal challenges, Oracle needs to have copyright ownership of all the code in that project.

By accepting an OCA, Oracle promises that it will make your contributions available under a free or open-source software license for as long as Oracle continues to distribute them.

You do not lose any rights to your contribution under the OCA. The OCA only asks you to share your rights. Unlike some contribution agreements that require you to transfer copyrights to another organization, the OCA does not take away your rights to your contributed intellectual property. When you agree to the OCA, you grant Oracle joint ownership in copyright, and a patent license for your contributions. You retain all rights, title, and interest in your contributions and may use them for any purpose you wish. Other than revoking the rights granted to Oracle, you still have the freedom to do whatever you want with your code.
